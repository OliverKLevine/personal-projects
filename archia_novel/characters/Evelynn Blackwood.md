Evelynn was only 16 when both of her parents disappeared, leaving her to pick up the pieces of their dwindling family fortune, occupy their seat in the House of Lords, and care for her two-year-old brother. Still, she survived and guided the house into a better financial and political position, before announcing her retirement when she was only 38 years old. She stuck around long enough to attend [[Marlow Blackwood|Marlow]]'s wedding before she took off on mysterious travels; [[Marlow Blackwood|Marlow]] has kept in contact with her through letters but she is sparse on the details of where she is and who she's with.
