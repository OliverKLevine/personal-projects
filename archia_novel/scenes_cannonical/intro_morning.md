Aoife believed her body was perfect and sacred. Or, she tried to. It had the color, sheen, and weight of obsidian. She had to be careful where she stepped; a stray footfall could break a child's bones. But in a way that was a kind of power, power her god, the revered Kolif'rem, had intended for her. 

Her eyes held the concentrated light of the sun; no one could look into them for more than a moment without being blinded. It felt lonely sometimes. But when the loneliness crept in, Aoife had but to remind herself that it was all as Kolif'rem intended. She blazed too brightly to fall in among lesser people. She was set apart, anointed to a holier path by Kolif'rem himself. That made sense, didn't it? 

Above all though, the greatest test of Aoife's faith was her hair. Like other fyreborn, her hair blazed with hot yellow fire that would burn the hands of mortal men. *Unlike* other fyreborn, her hair wasn't just the fire itself -- it was a mess of stringy, orange, humanlike hair that seemed set ablaze with an eternal flame. It seemed determined to grow at the normal human rate, and it was a source of constant *despair*--

*Blessings*, she reminded herself. *A source of constant blessings.* She gritted her teeth, clutching an ornately carved phoenix-bone comb as if it was her only lifeline, and tried to force herself to believe the words. Detangling the mess of stringy, flaming hair was an arduous task -- no, not that. It was a *sacred ritual* that she was only too happy to perform -- and it consumed several hours of her day each morning. For reasons she hadn't quite achieved the piety to comprehend, the fire in Aoife's hair went out when she slept, and when it did the strands retracted into tight, grey curls. Every morning when she awoke, so did the flame, and her hair spooled out into a maddening bramble of intertwining orange loops. *Most* clerics of her stature had a dozen aids fluttering about with deft hands that could tame even the most unruly hair in mere minutes, wrapping it up into the intricate, intertwining braids the Escherian people were so well-known for. But most clerics of her stature didn't have hair that would scald and blacken those careful hands at the slightest touch. So she tackled her hair herself, like a common woman.

"Maybe this is Kolif'rem's way of keeping me humble," she muttered to herself as she wiped away a blazing golden tear. But even that was almost blasphemous. There were gods in Archia that valued humility and taught their clerics to consider themselves among or even below the common man, but Kolif'rem was not among their number. Kolif'rem was a god of wrath, warfare, and supremacy. Truthfully, a better cleric of Kolif'rem would order a new attendant each day to replace the charred and ruined hands of the previous one. A better cleric would pay no more mind to the screams or the smell of burning flesh than the pops and pleasant smoky smell of a log burning in a campfire. A better cleric would --

Aoife shuddered, pausing a moment to wipe the sleep and frustrated tears from her eyes before redoubling her efforts with the comb. She pulled violently at the uncooperative knots. She averted her eyes from the ash that fell away as strands plucked out by the comb burned up almost instantly. And she did *not* turn to heresy to get herself through this ordeal, no matter how uncooperative her thoughts tried to be. 

"I am holy," she whispered to herself. Her voice shuddered with something like wonder as, the tangles conquered, her fingers finally began the first of many braids.

"I am worthy. I am sacred. My eyes blaze with the wrath of my god and my head is anointed with his fire."

She paused as she finished it, standing in front of the mirror, taking in the terrible and furious and radiant sight of herself.

"I am *scared,*" she finally admitted, her voice a tiny whisper, the words barely audible above the fire that crackled in her hair. Her eyes fell to her stomach, and without thinking she reached down to cradle it gently. It was undeniable now, visible even through her clothes. She was pregnant. 

This was what she wanted. Wasn't it? She and her husband had tried for years, and at great expense. Her lip quivered.

"Mommy!" the cry rung out clear and pure, cutting through Aoife's thoughts sharply but somehow hitting her like a blunt weapon to the chest. She almost had to catch her breath.

"What is it, baby?" Aoife called out, turning to face the door of her lavish dressing room. She smiled despite itself as she saw its handle turn slightly, and then wiggle, and then turn once more before the door burst open. 

"I want *you* to do my hair!" cried Niamh, almost flinging herself at Aoife. "Edda never gets it right."

Aoife almost tripped over her robes as she stumbled to get away from her daughter. "Niamh! Niamh! How many times have I told you, it's dangerous to come around Mommy when her hair is still out!"

Niamh practically skidded to a stop in front of her. "I'm sorry, momma. But--"

Just then the beleaguered governess appeared in the doorway. "My apologies, Lady Blackwood. If you would allow me," she began, already on her way to scoop up the unruly child. 

"It's alright, Edda," Aoife said, brushing the woman's hand away gently. "I'll fix her hair this morning. I'm not needed at the cathedral until this evening, anyway."

Edda looked uncertain. "If you're quite sure, Radiant Lady Blackwood." 

She paused. Aoife didn't waver. 

"Alright. I will have the cook breakfast for the both of you. Is Lord Blackwood in this morning?"

Aoife froze. She didn't know. But Edda recovered more quickly than she did.

"Well, I'll order enough for everyone," the woman said, carefully folding any judgement behind a practiced, neutral smile. "It will be warm and in the dining hall when you both are ready."

Aoife returned her smile. "Thank you, Edda. You're dismissed."

The woman nodded, turned, and left them, shutting the door gently behind herself.
