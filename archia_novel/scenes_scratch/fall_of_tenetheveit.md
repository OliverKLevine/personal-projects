Short description:
---
The first time Aoife felt a world end, it wasn’t her own. It stung anyway -- and not just the bitter cold that slammed into her until she felt her bones going brittle and her skin crack. She fell to her knees and screamed, the air in her lungs suddenly too heavy to form a proper prayer. All around her similar cries streamed out of desperate people, but they were silenced as quickly as they came. Aoife watched a woman reach for her throat as frost formed over her skin. She tried to claw at it but her fingers cracked when she tried to bend them. The woman looked up at Aoife then, eyes wide, tears crystallizing in them before they could escape. All Aoife could do for her was share in her horror as she died. 

Aoife had never felt the cold before -- not just like this, but at all. It was the bitterest thing she had ever experienced. It burned her -- *smothered* her -- but with a start, she realized she was still screaming, even after all the other cries had died. The orange-red glow of her hair had faded to an ashen grey, but magma still flowed in her veins. Not for long though. She had to do something, say something, to save at least her own life. She steeled herself and finally forced herself to bend the scream into something closer to a prayer. 

"*Kolif’rem*…"

The god’s name was difficult to form on her cracking lips. 

"Hear… your humble servant… who has never squandered your gifts…"

She took a heavy breath, and felt the cold sinking into her chest. "Set me alight with your cleansing fire!"

She felt the magic fill her then, steadying her. It wasn’t the wall of power that had hit her when the cold came, but it would keep her breathing. 

"Thank you," she whispered, "for hearing my calls even when I am so far away."

The prayer concluded, she looked up to survey the scene around her. Even the dizzying ecstasy that was Kolif’rem’s fire flowing through her veins couldn’t push aside the deep despair of her surroundings. There wasn't even snow here, just a thin layer of frost over everything she could see. The air felt dead somehow. The only sound was the crackle of the flames that had reignited in her hair. The only light was the glow that came off of her own body. Everything had just... ended, gone dark, snuffed out in almost an instant. She'd been standing in a crowded square, surrounded by the strange, martial people of this land. Now, she kneeled alone amid a field of uniformed corpses. Some of them had reached for each other -- many had died before they even had the chance. 

She took a deep breath. 

"What... *happened?*" she asked the empty air. Somehow she felt disappointed when it didn't respond.

"What kind of evil power is this, my lord?" she wondered aloud. "I was told Spiroch was a godless land, devoid of magic. So who here could do *this*?

No response came. Well, that was to be expected, she supposed. She was several days' travel from the end her god's normal reach. It was a minor miracle that he could lend her his power here; asking for guidance as well was almost profane. 

"I suppose I'm on my own," she whispered. She swallowed, trying to quell the rising panic in her chest. "Then. The only reasonable thing to do is figure out... just how far this destruction extends."

Still kneeling, she took a moment to readjust herself -- when its fire went out, her hair had curled tightly, pulling terribly at the braids and wraps she'd put it up in. Reignited with Kolifrem's fire, it unspooled, and the result was a tangled, flaming mess that pulled at her scalp in some places and splayed out in unkempt loops elsewhere. Her fingers shook as she undid and redid the braids. 

"Is it vain to fix my hair at the end of the world?" she wondered aloud. This time she was grateful that no one answered. Still she bit her lip, swallowing her next words. She would *not* curse Kolif'rem's gifts while his fire burned inside of her. Even the very thought was blasphemous. 

After some time, the worst of the braids redone, she carefully wrapped them together with a red ribbon and fixed the bundle to her abrhil, a cradle built into her robes to help support the weight of her bundled hair. Then she pushed herself to her feet. It was a strange feeling, standing alone in a foreign land, in a spire full of people and wondering if she was the only person in all the world left alive. Then she shivered, and suddenly wondered when Kolif'rem's generosity would reach its limit. 

"Is there... an end to this cold?" she wondered aloud as she took her first steps. She knew where to go -- well, where to start at least. Spiroch was a nation composed of six huge Spires, enormous towers built in a time that was now lost to history. Each floor of the tower housed a district so large it would have been considered a small city of its own in her home country of Escher. The floors were linked through the center by a huge elevator that d
