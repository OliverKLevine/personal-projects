"I sent Edda to pick up the post," Marlow said casually, opening the a drawer in one of their jewelry cabinets to fish around inside.

Aoife looked up from where she stood once again in front of the mirror, this time to adjust her ceremonial robes. "Marlow!" she called, half-amused, half-accusatory. "Edda isn't one of the servants. She's Niamh's governess. You can't just send her out on errands."

Marlow shrugged. "I'm hoping for a letter from my sister. I haven't heard from her in some time. Besides, Niamh's already down for a nap. Sometimes I get the feeling that woman doesn't know what to do with herself when Niamh's not around, don't you?"

"I decidedly don't," Aoife laughed, deciding her robes were arranged properly. She didn't like their high abrhil, the cradle for her bundled hair. It held her hair lofted up above her head, and it always gave Aoife the impression of a stone hovering just behind and above her, waiting for the right moment to bash in her skull. But the problem was just the construction of the robes themselves, not the way they were arranged, and no amount of fussing was going to fix it.

"Anyway," Marlow said. "Since there's no one else in the house, I was wondering if we could talk."

Aoife held a practiced neutrality. "Talk? What about?"

Marlow pouted at her. "*Aoife,*" he said, drawing out her name with a petulant groan. "Don't make me spell it out."

Aoife glanced over at him, a furtive smile sneaking onto her lips. "Spell what out?" she asked, her voice light and steady.

"Fine," he said. "You're pregnant."

Aoife's smile disappeared. "So it would seem."

He paused, she supposed, to take her reaction in. "Pretty..." he started trailing off. "Considerably pregnant. *Noticeably.* Noticeably pregnant. Just barely," he added, noticing her expression sour.

"Hmm," she hummed in acknowledgement. "So I am."

"So..." he swallowed. "Are we going to announce it? Or are you going to continue wearing your *ceremonial* robes to every evening's service?"

Aoife cringed, looking up at his face for a moment before closing her eyes. "I don't know," she said softly.
