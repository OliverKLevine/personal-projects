"I sent Edda to pick up the post," Marlow said casually, opening the a drawer in one of their jewelry cabinets to fish around inside.

Aoife looked up from where she stood once again in front of the mirror, this time to adjust her ceremonial robes. "Marlow!" she called, half-amused, half-accusatory. "Edda isn't one of the servants. She's Niamh's governess. You can't just send her out on errands."

Marlow shrugged. "I'm hoping for a letter from my sister. I haven't heard from her in some time. Besides, Niamh's already down for a nap. Sometimes I get the feeling that woman doesn't know what to do with herself when Niamh's not around, don't you?"

"I decidedly don't," Aoife laughed, deciding her robes were arranged properly. She didn't like their high abrhil, the cradle for her bundled hair. It held her hair lofted up above her head, and it always gave Aoife the impression of a stone hovering just behind and above her, waiting for the right moment to bash in her skull. But the problem was just the construction of the robes themselves, not the way they were arranged, and no amount of fussing was going to fix it.

"Anyway," Marlow said. "Since there's no one else in the house, I was wondering if we could talk."

Aoife held a practiced neutrality. "Talk? What about?"

Marlow pouted at her. "*Aoife,*" he said, drawing out her name with a petulant groan. "Don't make me spell it out."

Aoife glanced over at him, a furtive smile sneaking onto her lips. "Spell what out?" she asked, her voice light and steady.

"Fine," he said. "You're pregnant."

Aoife's smile disappeared. "So it would seem."

He paused, she supposed, to take her reaction in. "Pretty..." he started trailing off. "Considerably pregnant. *Noticeably.* Noticeably pregnant. Just barely," he added, noticing her expression sour.

"Hmm," she hummed in acknowledgement. "So I am."

"So..." he swallowed. "Are we going to announce it? Or are you going to continue wearing your *ceremonial* robes to every evening's service?"

Aoife cringed, looking up at his face for a moment before closing her eyes. "I don't know," she said softly. "What if I lose the baby?"

The question hung over them. 

"You're right," he said, almost a whisper. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to push you."

"It's alright," she whispered back. "You're my husband. You're the father of my..." she trailed off, swallowing her discomfort. "You have a right to know."

She almost jumped when she felt his hand on her shoulder. "Don't forget, I'm also your friend. You'll get through this. And I'll be here every step of the way."

She brushed his hand aside, turned away from him, and opened her eyes, studying the door intently. One of the servants passed by the open doorway, his footsteps picking up speed as he felt the heat of her gaze. 

"There's nothing to get through," she said, her voice detached, even, rehearsed. "This pregnancy is a blessing from Kolif'rem. I will change my robes at once."

"Ah." Marlow walked to the door and closed it gently. "You know I don't care whether you wear your standard clerical robes or your ceremonial ones," he said, his eyes reaching for contact that he knew she couldn't return. It was almost cruel in that way. "I mostly brought it up because I thought... Well, if you're pregnant, there's no need for us to..."

"You're right," she said, hoping her quick words sounded decisive, not defensive. 

He flinched anyways. 

Her gaze softened, and she did glance up to meet his eyes then before refocusing on the task of unwinding her carefully hoisted abhril. "We can discuss it at more length another time," she said softly. "I am afraid I..." she paused. "It is simply necessary that I spend more time in communion with Kolif'rem, to thank him for the gift he has bestowed upon us, before it is proper to discuss it with a mere mortal man." She said it with the self-seriousness a Radiant of Kolif'rem must, but her eyes twinkled as her hair fell from her abhril, and her lips twisted into a half-smile.

"Of course," he said, seeming more at ease. "I would never presume to be worthy of such a discussion before Kolif'rem himself." He grinned. "And I am already late to Lord Orphestion's evening soiree, so I don't have time for such a discussion myself."
